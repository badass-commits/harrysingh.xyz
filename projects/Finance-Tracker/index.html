<h1 id="building-my-own-finance-tracker-with-aspnet-mvc">Building My Own Finance Tracker with ASP.NET MVC</h1>

<p>For the longest time, I wasn‚Äôt really in control of my spending. I had a vague idea of where my money was going, but nothing concrete. I‚Äôd occasionally try a budgeting app, only to stop using it a week later. Most of them were either too complicated or just didn‚Äôt click with the way I think.</p>

<p>So I decided to build my own.</p>

<p>I called it <a href="https://github.com/badass-commits/finance-tracker">Finance Tracker</a>, and it‚Äôs a simple ASP.NET MVC web app that helps me track my income, expenses, and get a clearer picture of my financial habits.</p>

<h2 id="why-build-something-like-this">Why build something like this?</h2>

<p>Honestly, it started as a side project just to sharpen my .NET skills. But pretty quickly, I realized I could actually use it in my day-to-day life. I didn‚Äôt want a full-blown accounting system or a flashy app with graphs everywhere. I just wanted something clean, minimal, and functional.</p>

<p>I also liked the idea of owning my data. No ads, no cloud syncing, no subscriptions. Just a private tool that lives on my own machine (or a server I control) and helps me stay on top of things.</p>

<h2 id="what-it-does">What it does</h2>

<p>The app lets you:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Create categories for transactions (like ‚ÄúGroceries‚Äù, ‚ÄúSalary‚Äù, ‚ÄúSubscriptions‚Äù)</li>
  <li>Add income and expense entries with notes and timestamps</li>
  <li>View a simple dashboard that breaks down your finances</li>
  <li>Manage everything through a straightforward web interface</li>
</ul>

<p>There‚Äôs basic authentication using ASP.NET Identity, so it supports multiple users if needed. But right now, I‚Äôm the only one using it.</p>

<h2 id="how-its-built">How it‚Äôs built</h2>

<p>It‚Äôs a standard ASP.NET MVC project. Views are Razor-based, and I‚Äôm using Entity Framework Core with SQL Server for the backend. Nothing too fancy ‚Äî just a clean architecture and enough structure to make future features easy to add.</p>

<p>One thing I appreciated about sticking with MVC was the control over routing, view structure, and form handling. It felt a lot more straightforward than working within the constraints of a more ‚Äúopinionated‚Äù front-end-heavy stack.</p>

<h2 id="what-i-learned">What I learned</h2>

<p>Even though it‚Äôs not a huge project, working on this taught me a lot. Mainly, how small improvements to tooling can have a real impact on daily habits. I also got more comfortable working with Identity and EF Core migrations, and was reminded that building software for yourself is one of the most rewarding kinds of development.</p>

<h2 id="whats-next">What‚Äôs next</h2>

<p>Right now, I‚Äôm thinking about:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Adding recurring transactions</li>
  <li>Generating monthly reports</li>
  <li>Exporting data to CSV</li>
  <li>Making the UI more responsive for mobile</li>
</ul>

<p>Eventually, I might host it somewhere properly and secure it with HTTPS and 2FA. But for now, it‚Äôs just running locally ‚Äî and that‚Äôs enough.</p>

<h2 id="final-thoughts">Final thoughts</h2>

<p>This isn‚Äôt meant to compete with apps like YNAB or Mint. It‚Äôs just a personal tool that solves a problem for me, in a way that‚Äôs simple and satisfying. If you‚Äôre curious about the code or want to adapt it for your own needs, feel free to check out the repo:</p>

<p>And if you‚Äôve built something similar ‚Äî or are thinking about it ‚Äî I‚Äôd love to hear how you approached it.</p>
