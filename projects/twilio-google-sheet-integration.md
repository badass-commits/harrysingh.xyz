# Automating SMS Notifications with Twilio and Google Sheets

Managing customer communications can be streamlined by integrating Twilio with Google Sheets. This project demonstrates how to send SMS messages directly from a Google Sheet, making it easier to automate notifications like payment reminders or updates.

## Features

- **Google Apps Script Integration**: Utilize Apps Script to interact with Twilio's API.
- **Custom Menu in Google Sheets**: Add a user-friendly menu to trigger SMS sending.
- **Secure Credential Storage**: Store Twilio credentials securely using Google Sheets' Properties Service.
- **Status Tracking**: Update the sheet with the status of each message sent.

## Getting Started

1. **Set Up Your Google Sheet**:
   - Create a new Google Sheet.
   - Add columns: `Phone Number`, `Message`, `Status`.

2. **Access the Script Editor**:
   - In your Google Sheet, navigate to `Extensions` > `Apps Script`.

3. **Add the Script**:
   - Copy the script from the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/badass-commits/twilio-google-sheet-integration) and paste it into the Apps Script editor.

4. **Configure Twilio Credentials**:
   - In the script, set your Twilio Account SID, Auth Token, and Twilio phone number.

5. **Run the Script**:
   - Save and run the `sendSms` function to send messages.

## üõ†Ô∏è Customization

You can modify the script to:

- Send messages based on specific triggers or conditions.
- Personalize messages using data from other columns.
- Integrate with other services or APIs as needed.
