# 👋 Hi, I’m Harry Singh

I’m a software engineer who’s passionate about building elegant, scalable systems that solve real-world problems — and doing it with teams that care about quality, product, and people.

With over a decade of experience in full-stack and backend development, I’ve worked across industries like healthcare, education, and logistics — leading projects, shipping features, and mentoring engineers along the way.

## 🛠️ What I Do

I lead backend architecture for a platform that helps clinicians connect with job opportunities. I focus on designing systems that scale, writing clean and maintainable code, and collaborating closely with product managers and designers to bring ideas to life.

I’ve worked in both startup and enterprise environments, where I’ve:
- Designed distributed systems and core data flows  
- Led technical direction for cross-functional teams  
- Balanced speed and stability in fast-moving product cycles  
- Helped engineers grow through mentorship and shared learning  

## 💡 How I Work

I care deeply about the **intersection of engineering and product** — turning abstract ideas into practical, intuitive features. I believe in:
- Clear communication over clever code  
- Iteration over perfection  
- Learning over ego  

## 🧠 What Keeps Me Curious

I’m always exploring ways to improve — whether it’s fine-tuning system performance, leveling up in AI and distributed systems, or, yes, even practicing how to project my voice more clearly (communication is underrated in tech!).

If you’re building something meaningful and need a technical partner who sweats the details — I’d love to connect.
